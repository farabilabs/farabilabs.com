We created a course to help people ages 18-80 learn to answer the question "What improves my learning?".

### Conceptual Outline

- uncertainty (eg. trust, goal, path, approach, etc)
- discomfort (eg. confusion, opp cost, physio, etc)
- fear of shame (eg. peers, leaders, outsiders, etc)
- lack of measurable progress (eg. my values, on my own terms)
- lack of social accountability (eg. belonging, reciprocity, etc)
- lack of motivating frame (eg. my purpose, my mission)
