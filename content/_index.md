## Our Mission

Our mission is to establish a leading-edge, bilingual tech community in Egypt and the greater Middle East, dedicated to bridging the gaps in access to technology education and embracing the rapid advancements in AI and other tech fields.

Recognizing the challenges posed by language barriers and the lack of experimental tech culture in Egypt, our initiative seeks to provide a platform where individuals from diverse backgrounds can converge to learn, innovate, and grow together.

## Our Audience

We target a wide audience range, from school children eager to understand the tech world to mid-career and senior professionals looking to enhance their skills and stay ahead of tech trends.

Our core values include a commitment to *nullius in verba*, radical candor, an experimental mindset, and psychological safety, ensuring that our community is a place for open, honest, and innovative exploration of technology.

## Our Plan

Over the next five years, we envision thousands of people, young and old, engaging with our community, contributing to open-source projects, and establishing connections worldwide.

We aim to be recognized both locally and globally as a community that nurtures and retains top talent from all walks of life, irrespective of their socio-economic background.

## Our Approach

Our educational approach is centered on overcoming barriers to learning, such as uncertainty, discomfort, and fear of shame.

We insist on authentic student-teacher relationships, a dynamic and emergent curriculum, and a learning environment that encourages exploration and failure as stepping stones to success.

We are committed to engaging with the industry and technical community, ensuring our members receive education that is relevant and practical.

## Our Community

The community aspect is the cornerstone of our initiative, providing a self-correcting and self-supporting environment, essential for personal and professional growth.

We also focus on career advancement, maintaining strong ties with local and international companies to provide our members with opportunities for professional development.

Culturally, we embrace Egypt's unique context by offering bilingual content and integrating local culture into our events and programs.

Staying current with tech trends is achieved through active participation in technical events and the launch of our own newsletters.

## Our Success

Success for us is measured through tangible metrics such as the increase in website visitors, active community engagement, course participation, and the growth of our partnerships.

Ultimately, our mission is to create a thriving tech ecosystem in Egypt, where learning, innovation, and community go hand in hand towards building a technologically empowered future."
