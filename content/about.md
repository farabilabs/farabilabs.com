## Why "Farabi" Labs?
Abu Nasr Muhammad al-Farabi (أبو نصر محمد الفارابي; c. 870 — 950), known in the Latin West as Alpharabius, was an early Islamic philosopher and music theorist.

His fields of philosophical interest included—but not limited to, philosophy of society and religion; philosophy of Language and Logic; psychology and epistemology; metaphysics, political philosophy, and ethics.

He was an expert in both practical musicianship and music theory, and although he was not intrinsically a scientist, his works incorporate astronomy, mathematics, cosmology, and physics.

That he was more than a pioneer in Islamic philosophy can be deduced from the habit of later writers calling him the "Second Master", with Aristotle as the first.
